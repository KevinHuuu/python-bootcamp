# Start the Python interpreter and use it as a calculator.
# Python's syntax for math operations is almost the same as
# standard mathematical notation. For example, the symbols
# +, - and / denote addition, subtraction and division, as you would expect.
# The symbol for multiplication is *.

# If you run a 10 kilometer race in 42 minutes 42 seconds, what is your
# average pace (time per mile in minutes and seconds)? What is your average
# speed in miles per hour?

# Insert Answers
# Average Pace (minutes & seconds per mile): 4 minutes 16.2 seconds
# Average Speed in MPH:  14.05 MPH

# Insert calculations below (paste from the interpreter):
2562/10 // 60 = 4
256.2 - (2562/10 // 60)*60 = 16.19999999999999

1/((42 * 60 + 42)/10) * 3600 = 14.05152224824356
